Probability of 72 ties in a row: This is simply the probability of a tie happening on each round 72 times, so it's (1/9)^72.
Probability of any non-tie outcome: Once we have 72 ties, the next round must break the tie and therefore not be a tie. This means the probability of any non-tie outcome is 1 - (probability of a tie) = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.
